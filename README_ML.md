## Mock-up Model

There are three models being trained for the provisional data. 

** A Logistic Regression model - Accuracy score : 0.43
** A Deep Neural Network model - Accuracy score : 0.50
** A Random Forest Ensemble Classifier model - Accuracy score : 0.38

All models currently have the baseline performance level of 50 percent or less. However, it is anticipated that the models' performances will significantly improve as the real database is fed into them. The mock-up database is significantly smaller and has only a portion of the features that will be used to train the model. 

The goal of these models is to predict a binary outcome - whether a song will be successful or not - analyzing its lyrics and genre. The suggested models could each be useful for this purpose.
