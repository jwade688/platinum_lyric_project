# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Python and Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis in Jupyter Notebook.

## Database Storage
We intend to use a PostgreSQL database to store the data, which will be integrated with our machine learning model and with the app's JavaScript file to create visualizations.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the Python Machine Learning library we will be using to create the classifier.

## Dashboard
The dashboard will be created using JavaScript, including interactive visualizations using D3.js to retrieve data from our database, as well as Tableau visualizations. The final app will be deployed to GitHub Pages.
